I am broadly interested in science and public policy with particular focus on immigration and foreign policy. I am a member of the [National Science Policy Network](https://scipolnetwork.org/) and the [Rice Science Policy Network](https://twitter.com/ricescipol?lang=en). My publications on these issues are listed below.
