I am a graduate student in the [Systems, Synthetic, and Physical Biology](https://sspb.rice.edu/) PhD Program at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/). I carry out research work under the guidance of [Prof. Herbert Levine](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/levine-herbert/). Currently, I am an intern in Clinical Pharmacology at [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/).
Broadly, my research work focuses on using concepts and tools from physics to understand how cancer cells exhibit widespread phenotypic plasticity and how such plastic behavior contributes towards the emergence of resistance to anti-cancer drugs.
