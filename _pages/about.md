I am a postdoctoral associate in the [Yale Center for Systems and Engineering Immunology](https://medicine.yale.edu/systems-engineering-immunology/) and the [Department of Immunobiology](https://medicine.yale.edu/immuno/) at the [Yale School of Medicine](https://medicine.yale.edu/), working with Prof. John Tsang. My current research work focuses on the systems biology of the immune response to perturbations such as infections and vaccinations. I am particularly interested in the maintenance of immune homeostasis across scales, as well as in the mechanisms driving heterogeneity in immune responses to the same perturbation.

My postdoctoral research is supported by the [Yale-Boehringer Ingelheim Biomedical Data Science Fellowship](https://medicine.yale.edu/cbds/bdsfellowship/).

I graduated from the [Systems, Synthetic, and Physical Biology](https://sspb.rice.edu/) PhD Program at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) in August 2022. During my PhD, I worked towards identifying certain general principles underlying cell-fate choice, with a focus on the emergence of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. I finished my PhD dissertation under the guidance of [Prof. Herbert Levine](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/levine-herbert/). You can find my dissertation [here](https://repository.rice.edu/items/053fe21c-2ce6-46bc-8856-ec8cd2b37b64).
