I am a graduate student in the [Systems, Synthetic, and Physical Biology](https://sspb.rice.edu/) PhD Program at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/). Currently, I am a visiting research scholar in the [Department of Physics](https://cos.northeastern.edu/physics/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). I work with [Prof. Herbert Levine](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/levine-herbert/).
Broadly, my research work focuses on using concepts and tools from physics to understand how cancer cells exhibit widespread phenotypic plasticity and how such plastic behavior contributes towards the emergence of resistance to anti-cancer drugs.
