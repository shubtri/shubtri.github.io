Served as a teaching assistant for a graduate-level class taught by Prof. Oleg Igoshin during the Spring Semester, 2018. The class included modules on bioinformatics, deterministic and stochastic modeling of biological circuits, molecular dynamics simulations, image analysis, and processing of -seq data. I conducted tutorial sessions which involved teaching introductory computer programming (in MATLAB) to students, including those with little to no programming experience. Additionally, I contributed towards the creation of homework assignments (this was the first year the class was being taught in this form) and graded both homework assignments and class projects.
